It is suggested that extraordinarily intense storms are largely due to an abnormal growth of the rapidly decaying part. Because of its rapid decay, the combination with the slow decay part gives a rather sharp change of decay rate, which is commonly seen for great storms. The results are discussed in the light of present theoretical knowledge.",10.1029/JZ068i011p03345,http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ068i011p03345,2156-2202,68,The main phase of great magnetic storms,article,akasofu_main_1963,,,,

A new model electric current system is presented to account for such an asymmetry. It is suggested that there is a gap in the ring current belt on the night side, and that the ring current is closed through the ionosphere.

This substorm oval is also the site along which at the instant the active aurora is situated. Further, it appears to be the line of intersection of the outer boundary of the outer radiation belt with the ionosphere. The center of the oval is appreciably displaced from the earth's magnetic axis pole, along the midnight meridian. The oval coincides approximately with the statistically determined auroral zone only in the midnight sector. The strength of the polar electrojet is not uniform along the substorm oval; some of the excess current in the most intense part of the electrojet (near the midnight meridian) returns across the polar cap, encircling a focus in this cap; the remainder departs from the afternoon sector and crosses the midnight meridian to complete its circuit by rejoining the main westward flow in the morning sector, with its focus in the midnight sector not far outside the oval. This latter flow produces positive bays everywhere south of the focus; these bays can be particularly intense in the afternoon sector along the auroral zone, and were formerly interpreted as indicating the existence of an eastward polar electrojet. The changing geometry of the polar eleetrojet is brought into relation with the dynamical morphology of the simultaneous auroral substorm, which has lately been determined by study of simultaneous all-sky camera records from the entire polar region.",10.1016/0021-9169(65)90087-5,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021916965900875,0021-9169,27,The polar electrojet,article,akasofu_polar_1965,November,,,

Model results indicate that dry and cold air advection due to an equatorward increase in sea-surface temperature results in a boundary layer that is less than 1 ° cooler and 1 g kg-1 drier than that obtained for steady-state horizontally homogeneous conditions. Although the magnitude of the advection terms in the heat and moisture budgets may be relatively large, below the inversion they are generally balanced by increased convective heating and moistening. The downstream variations in the temperatures below the inversion are relatively insensitive to variations in any of the external parameters and were generally within 1 °C of the homogeneous solutions. The mixing ratio, however, is sensitive to variations in the surface wind speed and the thermodynamic structure above the inversion.The height of the trade inversion obtained for the various downstream experiments was found to differ significantly from the horizontally homogeneous solutions. These differences indicate that the height of the inversion may depend more on upstream rather than local conditions.

Over the dark hemisphere the aurora occurred overhead in a strip of varying width that lay parallel to the auroral zone. Its northern border fluctuated considerably during the storm, in parallel with the occurrence of polar magnetic sub-storms (DP) during the main storm. In the quiet intervening intervals, the northern border of the strip of aurora descended to geomagnetic latitude 50°N. During these quiet intervals, the aurora was completely absent from the region of the auroral zone, where normally it is most frequent and intense. During the DP's the strip was widest, and expanded mainly by northward movement of its northern border. The southern border moved slightly southward at the same time, but its latitude was nearly constant throughout the main Dst phase of the storm.

The atmospheric pressure is measured with a pressure transducer connected to the central opening of a round disk—the pressure port. Wind tunnel tests were conducted to determine wind effects an the atmospheric pressure measured with this port. Three port designs were tested in the wind tunnel and their performances were compared. It was found that the two with symmetric edges performed the best at high wind speeds. The expected pressure errors were evaluated for normal PAM II operation and were generally found to be less than the rms error in the pressure transducers. For special circumstances where these pressure errors cannot be neglected, the wind tunnel data and the procedures discussed here can be used to make appropriate corrections if the horizontal and vertical components of the wind velocity at the height of the pressure port are measured.

The observed N-S asymmetries over a 2-year period (1973–1974) are found to be related to asymmetries in the sizes of selected solar polar holes; the hemisphere with the smaller hole has a larger cosmic ray flux. An analysis is also made of the N-S asymmetries for intervals when there exists a relatively symmetric coronal region (±40°) about the solar equator; the N-S asymmetry tends to be small for this situation of comparable-sized polar coronal holes. We discuss various mechanisms which can contribute to a N-S asymmetry. The radial gradient drift effect (▽n × B) alone probably cannot explain a N-S asymmetry.

Hough harmonics are eigensolutions of free oscillations (normal modes) for linearized shallow water equations over a sphere about a basic state of rest and a prescribed equivalent height. Hough harmonics are expressed by Θls exp(isλ) with zonal wavenumber s, longitude λ and meridional index l. Hough vector functions Θls consist of three components-zonal velocity U, meridional velocity V and geopotential height Z, all functions of latitude. There are three modes with distinct frequencies for s≥1: eastward and westward propagating gravity waves and westward propagating rotational waves of the Rossby/Haurwitz type. The advantage of using Hough harmonies for a spectral barotropic global primitive equation model is that the prognostic variables are efficiently represented because Hough harmonics are normal modes of the prediction model. Initialization is no longer a separate procedure but is built into the forecasting scheme. The characteristics of wave motions are associated with the expansion functions, so that the filtering of unwanted wave components can be performed easily. The nonlinear advection term in the spectral equation is calculated by the transform method–a combination of Fourier transform and Gaussian quadrature. The results of a test calculation with a balanced non-divergent initial state (a Haurwitz wave) compare favorably with those of an integration using a fourth-order finite-difference model.",10.1175/1520-0469(1977)034<0687:NIOTGB>2.0.CO;2,https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469(1977)034%3C0687%3ANIOTGB%3E2.0.CO%3B2,0022-4928,34,Numerical {Integration} of the {Global} {Barotropic} {Primitive} {Equations} with {Hough} {Harmonic} {Expansions},article,kasahara_numerical_1977,May,,,

The NMF's are constructed from the eigensolutions of a global primitive equation model and they are orthogonal functions. The vertical parts are obtained from the solutions of the vertical structure equation with the equivalent height as the eigenvalue. The vertical modal index is associated with a different value of the equivalent height. The horizontal parts of NMF's are Hough harmonics with zonal wavenumber and meridional modal index as two-dimensional scalings. The expansion of global data in terms of NMF's permits the partition of energy into two distinct kinds of motions-gravity-inertia modes and rotational modes of Rossby/Haurwitz type. Both kinds of motion are also partitioned into different vertical modes. Results of the spectral distribution of atmospheric energy, obtained by expanding in the NMF's hemispherical data of the National Meteorological Center, are presented.

We investigate, in this paper, the occurrence of non-elliptic regions, using the FWE level IIIb analyses of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts. We found that non-elliptic regions are ubiquitous in the tropics. For the traditional balance equation, non-elliptic regions are not realizable in the sense that balanced flows are not physically possible. To reconcile this dilemma, we postulate that the traditional balance equation lacks an additional term due, for example, to the effects of subgrid-scale motions. We evaluated this additional term as the residual by computing each term in the balance equation. This additional term modifies the ellipticity criterion of the balance equation. We call the modified ellipticity condition the realizability condition. This study concludes that the non-elliptic regions found in the tropics satisfy the realizability condition when this additional term in the balance equation is considered. This suggests that the apparent dilemma may be resolved by taking into account presently lacking physical processes in achieving the dynamical balance between the mass and wind fields, if the FGGE level IIIb analyses are supposed to be correct.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}",10.1175/1520-0493(1982)110<1956:SONERI>2.0.CO;2,https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/110/12/1520-0493_1982_110_1956_soneri_2_0_co_2.xml,"1520-0493, 0027-0644",110,Significance of {Non}-{Elliptic} {Regions} in {Balanced} {Flows} of the {Tropical} {Atmosphere},article,kasahara_significance_1982,December,,,

One is called the nonlinear normal mode procedure, developed by Baer and Machenhauer. It is suitable for a global primitive equation model in which the construction of the model normal modes is feasible. The other approach is called the bounded derivative method, proposed by Kreiss. It can be applicable to both pure initial value and initial boundary value problems. Leith established a connection between the nonlinear normal mode procedure and the classical balancing based on quasi-geostrophic theory. The purpose of this paper is to compare the three procedures of initialization for a baroclinic primitive equation model with beta plane geometry in pressure coordinates. To the degree of approximation employed, the initialization by the bounded derivative method agrees with the classical balance procedure with quasi-geostrophic assumptions. We demonstrate for the same prediction model that nonlinear normal mode balancing leads to an initialization scheme identical to the one derived from the bounded derivative method within the degree of approximations. Since both new approaches to initialization are more general than the classical procedures, the connection of the two approaches with the quasi-geostrophic formulation will enhance our understanding of the dynamics of large-scale motions beyond the classical quasi-geostrophic theory.",https://doi.org/10.1029/RG020i003p00385,http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/RG020i003p00385,1944-9208,20,Nonlinear normal mode initialization and the bounded derivative method,article,kasahara_nonlinear_1982,,,,

There is an obvious advantage in using an orthogonal set of expansion functions. We propose in this paper the construction of orthogonal vertical structure functions for the NNMI with an atmospheric prediction model for which non-orthogonal vertical structure functions have been adopted in the past. We discuss the difference between the new formulation which yields orthogonal vertical structure functions and the old formulation which does not, in general, yield orthogonality.

With the inclusion of a zonal flow, the vertical shear of the zonal wind permits the coupling of the external mode with the internal vertical modes. As a result of the coupling, a significant response occurs in the external mode due to the excitation of the “baroclinic” internal modes by tropical heating. The meridional structures of internal vertical modes are equatorially trapped and their intensities are less affected by the basic zonal flow. Since the meridional structures of the external mode is global, a significant response of the external mode to tropospheric tropical heating is no longer confined to the tropics. The direction of the basic zonal flow and its meridional shear have a profound influence on the intensity of planetary waves in the mid- to higher latitudes generated by stationary tropical heating.

The normal modes are free solutions to the timedependent perturbation equations linearized around the atmosphere at rest. To demonstrate the feasibility ofnormal mode representation in the spectral vertical discretization, the vertical normal mode expansion is appliedto the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation to investigate the traditional baroclinic instability of Charneyand Green types on a zonal flow with a constant vertical shear. The convergence of the numerical solutions isexamined in detail in relation to the spectral resolution of expansion functions.We then extend the method of vertical normal mode expansion to solve the problem of baroclinic instabilityon the sphere. Two aspects are different from the earlier example. One is use of the primitive equations insteadof the quasi-geostrophic system and the other is application of normal mode expansions in the horizontal, aswell as vertical direction. First, we derive the evolution equations for the spectral coefficients of truncated seriesin three-dimensional normal mode functions by application of the Galerkin procedure to the global primitiveequations linearized around a basic zonal flow with vertical and meridional shear. Then, an eigenvalue-eigenfunction problem is solved to investigate the stability of perturbation motions superimposed on the 30' jetexamined earlier by Simmons, Hoskins and Frederiksen.

This work focuses examination on the role of baroclinic instability in generating external-mode motions under the influence of a specified anomalous tropical heating. We found that the process of baroclinic instability of zonal flows can be considered as a cooperative action with tropical heating in the generation of external-mode motions which cause global barotropic-type responses. However, the effectiveness of each process in energy generation is different. For example, the efficiency of generation with tropical heating is greatly reduced in the easterlies and also with decreased longitudinal heating scales. By contrast, the efficiency of generation with baroclinic instability has the opposite tendencies. Hence, the two processes are likely complementary to each other. Other information obtained from the present transient study, but not from previous stationary response studies, is the time scale of generating external-mode motions by the two processes. The time scale of response involving tropical heating as measured by the leveling-off of internal-mode energy level is approximately 10 days. On the other hand, the time scale of response that it takes to produce the solutions close to the steady states under stationary heating is in the range of 20 to 40 days under reasonable energy dissipation rates.",10.2151/jmsj1965.69.3_293,,,69,Transient {Response} of {Planetary} {Waves} to {Tropical} {Heating}: {Role} of {Baroclinic} {Instability},article,kasahara_transient_1991,,Transient {Response} of {Planetary} {Waves} to {Tropical} {Heating},,

Other questions to be investigated are: What aspects of the analyses have improved in the FGGE reanalyses produced at the ECMWF and NMC? What aspects of the analyses are still unsatisfactory? What can be done to further improve the analyses? Since data agreement tends to be weak in the tropics, attention is focused in the tropical belt of 30°N–30°S. One enlightening finding is that both ζ and δ of the NMC reanalyses agree more closely with the ECMWF reanalyses than their earlier analyses. This result may indicate that both the data quality and the analysis techniques have improved. More good news is found in that the agreement of ζ at T13 is excellent, while there is only slight disagreement at T42, indicating that FGGE has succeeded in describing the quasi-rotational state of the atmosphere, even in the tropics.

The daily variations of tropospheric diabatic heating appear to be related to synoptic features of the global circulation, indicating that the diagnosed heating distributions provide useful information related to numerical weather prediction.

In separate experiments, prescribed changes in surface temperature are imposed in the Western Arabian Sea, the Eastern Arbian Sea or the Central Indian Ocean. The influence of these anomaly patterns on the simulated summer monsoon circulation is evaluated in terms of the geographical distribution of the prescribed change response for any field of interest. This response is defined as the grid point difference between a 30-day mean from a prescribed change experiment and the ensemble average of the 30-day means from the control population for which the same set of climatological ocean surface temperatures are used in each simulation. The statistical significance of such a prescribed change response is estimated by relating the normalized response (defined as the ratio of the prescribed change response to the standard deviation of 30-day means as estimated from the finite sample of control cases) to the classical Student'st-statistic. Using this methodology, the most prominent and statistically significant features of the model's response are increased vertical velocity and precipitation over warm anomalies and typically decreased vertical velocity and precipitation in some preferred region adjacent to the prescribed change region. In the case of cold anomalies, these changes are of opposite sign. However, none of the imposed anomaly patterns produces substantial or statistically significant precipitation changes over large areas of the Indian sub-continent. The only evidence of a major nonlocal effect is found in the experiment with a large positive anomaly (+3°C) in the Central Indian Ocean. In this instance, vertical velocity and precipitation are reduced over Malaysia and a large area of the Equatorial Western Pacific Ocean. Thus, while these anomaly experiments produce only a local response (for the most part), it is hoped, as one of the purposes of the planned Monsoon Experiment (MONEX), that the necessary data will be provided to produce detailed empirical evidence on the extent to which Indian Ocean surface temperature anomalies correlate with precipitation anomalies over the Indian subcontinent—a correlation which generally does not appear in these GCM results.",10.1007/BF00874412,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00874412,1420-9136,115,Effects of a variety of {Indian} {Ocean} surface temperature anomaly patterns on the summer monsoon circulation: {Experiments} with the {NCAR} general circulation model,article,washington_effects_1977,September,Effects of a variety of {Indian} {Ocean} surface temperature anomaly patterns on the summer monsoon circulation,,

All experiments are compared to control runs with the present amount of CO2. The experiments use annually averaged solar forcing; thus, there is not a seasonal cycle. It is found that globally averaged surface air temperature in the doubled CO2 experiments increases 1.3°C for the fixed cloud formulation and 1.3°C for the computed cloud case. In the quadrupled CO2 experiment with fixed clouds the surface air temperature increase is 2.7°C, and, in the computed cloud it increases 3.4°C. Warming throughout the troposphere is of the order of 1°–2°C for the doubled CO2 cases, and the stratosphere at 30 km cools up to 6°C. In the quadrupled experiment the maximum tropospheric warming is 4°C, and the model stratospheric cooling is 11°C. An analysis of geographic areas of persistent change in snow cover and soil moisture due to a doubling of CO2 for the fixed cloud case shows a general retreat of the snow line and drying of the soil in tropics and mid-latitudes with increases of snow depth in the polar regions.

Globally averaged, the annual mean surface air temperature increase computed over the last 3 years of an integration with a full annual cycle for 2×CO2 compared to the control for ×CO2 is 3.5°C. Zonal mean air temperature differences indicate stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming as seen in Other CO2 modeling studies. Greatest increases of surface air temperature in the 2×CO2 case, compared to the control, occur near the sea ice margins. Retreat of sea ice in the 2×CO2 case is associated with changes in the positions of the cloud maxima. Ice-free areas of ocean in the 2×CO2 case, which are ice covered in the 1×CO2 case, store relatively more heat during the summer season. Warmer surface air temperatures then occur in areas that are much colder in the control case because of the lack of the insulating effect of the sea ice, especially in winter. Increases of zonal mean precipitation are evident at most latitudes as a result of increases of available moisture evaporated from the warmer oceans. In the tropics this is associated with a strengthening of the mean meridional circulation and with intensification of the upper level zonal-component winds in the subtropics. Warming near the surface associated with the retreat of the ice line in the 2×CO2 case slackens the meridional temperature gradient and results in weaker upper level zonal-component winds in the mid-latitudes. Three-year seasonal means of soil moisture show decreases in tropical and subtropical continental areas and increases at high latitudes, but at mid-latitudes the change depends on the season. An analysis of the statistical significance of the geographical distribution of 7-year seasonal means of surface air temperature and soil moisture differences is given for the 2×CO2 case compared to the control. Areas of significant differences correspond to similar regions of large differences seen in the 3-year seasonal means. Certain regions experience summer drying seen in other studies, but zonal mean soil moisture differences show increases of soil moisture at mid and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere year-round, with a relative minimum of increase in late summer. These differences are attributed to large increases of soil moisture in late spring that persist into summer and cause a positive feedback with precipitation and low clouds. This inhibits continental warming and limits summer drying seen in the zonal mean as a result of the doubling of CO2. A comparison of the present experiment with the previous swamp model experiments is consistent with other studies in that the extent of sea ice in the control case critically influences the climatic response to increased CO2 such that more extensive sea ice is associated with a larger response. The seasonal cycle along with ocean heat storage in the mixed layer model are shown to be important in producing a more realistic simulation of the present climate than does the swamp experiment and, presumably, a more credible response to increased CO2. However, in the context of recent studies the overextensive sea ice in the present mixed layer model suggests that the inclusion of ocean heat transport from a fully computed ocean model and a resulting sea ice distribution closer to the observed would possibly produce less of a response to increased CO2.",https://doi.org/10.1029/JD089iD06p09475,http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JD089iD06p09475,2156-2202,89,Seasonal cycle experiment on the climate sensitivity due to a doubling of {CO2} with an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a simple mixed-layer ocean model,article,washington_seasonal_1984,,,,Copyright 1984 by the American Geophysical Union.

The spatial dependence of the spatial diffusion coefficient is linked to that of the fluid velocity profile and its momentum dependence is taken to be a power law.The solution corresponding to monoenergetic particle injection at the shock front and with free escape of particles at finite distances both upstream and downstream of the shock is investigated in detail. The accelerated particle spectrum does not exhibit the characteristic power law with power-law index dependent only on the compression ratio of the shock at any momentum, and is dominated at high energies by an exponential cut-off. This behaviour results from the competition between acceleration by the first-order Fermi mechanism and particle loss through the free-escape boundaries.
