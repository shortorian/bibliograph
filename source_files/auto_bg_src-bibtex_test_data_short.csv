@article{wiin-nielsen_truncation_1962,
 abstract = {Some estimates of truncation errors due to vertical finite differences are given. The truncation errors amount to at most 10 \% in the phase-speed of the basic mode in a model atmosphere in which the vertical shear of the basic, zonal flow vanishes. An increase of the vertical resolution results in rapidly decreasing truncation errors in this case.In a model atmosphere, in which the vertical windshear is different from zero, and the static stability parameter is a function of pressure, we find small truncation errors in the initial displacement of the wave, but large errors in the initial amplification.The initial development of a baroclinic wave is evaluated in three different baroclinic models. The models differ only in the vertical variation of the static stability parameter which is a simple function of pressure in the first model, a constant in the next and zero in the third model. It is shown that the vertical variation of static stability is important for the amplification and the slope of the wave in the vertical direction.The initial change of the kinetic energy in the models is computed as a function of wave-length. It is shown that the change of kinetic energy is larger in the models where the static stability parameter is constant or zero than in the models where it varies with pressure.The last section contains some comments on the upper boundary condition. It is shown that the conditions ? and ? μ ?(? = geopotential) at the upper boundary are equivalent in certain problems.},

@article{squires_entraining_1962,
 abstract = {A model of a cumulo-nimbus updraught is presented, based on a steady-state, turbulent, condensing plume, entraining environmental air according to the simple law that the inflow velocity at any height is proportional to the upward velocity of the plume. With this model, the shape of the cloud as well as its other properties follow from the dynamics, and cloud development is size-dependent. The virtual temperature excess at cloud base is taken as zero; this seems the only appropriate assumption for a steadystate plume model. The thermodynamical treatment is made with few approximations, and the effect of freezing on the dynamics is included in a simple fashion. Some preliminary calculations result in realistic cloud shapes and reasonable values for the internal properties.},

As an aid in interpretation of satellite observations, the anisotropy of out-going radiation at the top of the atmosphere and at the satellite level is computed for different atmospheric models and spectral regions to characterize radiation from the lower, middle, and high troposphere. It is shown that limb darkening is an extremely sharp property of the atmosphere as viewed from an orbiting satellite.},

@article{haurwitz_wind_1962,
 abstract = {Observations of the diurnal (S1) and semidiurnal (S2) wind oscillations between 80 and 100 km show that their amplitudes are of the same magnitude as the mean winds. Both periods show pronounced seasonal changes in the same sense as, but much larger than would be expected from surface data forS2, and in agreement with the idea of a thermal cause forS1. From the observed wind oscillations the pressure oscillations can be computed. The pressure amplitudes are about 5 percent or, especially forS2, more of the mean pressure, indicating a fifty to hundred-fold increase compared to the low atmosphere, as suggested by theory. But the phase ofS2 does not show the expected reversal relative to the ground.S1 seems to be much more regular than at the earth's suface where it is greatly disturbed by local influences. The few data on the lunar semidiurnal (L2) oscillation show also the increse of the amplitudes with height.},

@article{akasofu_main_1963,
 abstract = {It is shown that the main phase of great magnetic storms is composed of two parts, most clearly characterized by their decay rate: one decays much more rapidly than the other. It is suggested that extraordinarily intense storms are largely due to an abnormal growth of the rapidly decaying part. Because of its rapid decay, the combination with the slow decay part gives a rather sharp change of decay rate, which is commonly seen for great storms. The results are discussed in the light of present theoretical knowledge.},

@article{akasofu_enhancement_1963,
 abstract = {It is shown that the growth of auroral electrojects can greatly enhance the equatorial electro jet. This indicates that a part of the return current, spreading from the auroral zone to the ionosphere in low and middle latitudes, can extend to as far as the late afternoon side along the magnetic equator. The current systems inferred so far for polar magnetic substorms may have to be revised to include such an intense return current. The enhancement is used to infer the distribution of the highly conductive region along the magnetic equator. It is shown that the conductivity is about 4–7 times higher there than in middle latitudes.},

@article{latham_generation_1961,
 abstract = {The electrical charging which results from collisions between ice crystals and a simulated hailstone is measured as a function of their temperature difference, and of the size and impact velocity of the crystals. It is found that the sign of the charging is governed by that of the temperature difference, the hailstone becoming negatively charged if it is warmer than the rebounding crystals. The magnitude of the charging is proportional to the temperature difference but rather insensitive to the size and impact velocity of the crystals. With a temperature difference of 5 ⚬C, a rebounding crystal of diameter about 50 μ produces, on average, a charge of 5 × 10-9 e.s.u. The electrification of an artificial pellet of soft hail growing by the accretion of supercooled water droplets (riming) is also investigated. Freezing of the droplets on the hailstone is accompanied by the ejection of positively charged ice splinters, the hailstone acquiring a negative charge. The manner in which the rates of charging and splinter production vary with the air temperature, drop diameter and impact velocity has been established. In a typical experiment, with the air temperature at -15 ⚬C, droplets of diameter 80 μ impacting at 10 m s-1 freeze to produce, on average, 12 splinters and a charge of 4 × 10-6 e.s.u. per drop. Droplets of diameter less than 30 μ produce few splinters and little charging. The results of both sets of experiments are interpreted in terms of the authors' theory of charge separation in ice under the influence of a temperature gradient, and are used to calculate probable rates of charge generation in thunderstorms. It appears that the electrification which accompanies the growth of pellets of soft hail through the freezing and splintering of supercooled droplets is capable of generating and separating charge at the required rate of about 1 C km-3 min-1 but, while rebounding ice crystals will usually charge the hailstones in the same (negative) sense, this mechanism will contribute only slightly to thunderstorm electrification.},
